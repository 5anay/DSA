## Sorting Algorithms Collection

Selection Sort: A straightforward algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted segment and moves it to the beginning.

Insertion Sort: Elements are consumed in sequence and each new element is placed into its correct position among the previously sorted elements.

Bubble Sort: A beginner-friendly algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Merge Sort: A powerful divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the original array into smaller arrays until each small array can be sorted and then merged back together.

QuickSort: A highly efficient sorting algorithm that picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.

Counting Sort: An integer sorting algorithm that operates by counting the number of objects that possess distinct key values, then doing some arithmetic to calculate the position of each object in the output sequence.

Radix Sort: A non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value.
